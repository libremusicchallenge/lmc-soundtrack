Welcome to the Libre Music Challenge, a friendly contest where we make music with free and open source software exclusively.

A new challenge is unveiled every two months, with its own set of constraints and prizes.

You are welcome to join, at any skill level.  It is a place for learning, sharing knowledge, and an opportunity to explore creativity through limitation.  And most importantly, to inspire you to make some music!
